# Introduction 

We will be performing 2 tasks within the framework of this work/report.

TASK #1 - EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON TEXT DATA

  The first step in building a predictive model for text is understanding the distribution and relationship between the words, tokens, and phrases in the text.   The goal of this task is to understand the basic relationships you observe in the data and prepare to build our first linguistic models.

Tasks to accomplish:

  1. Exploratory analysis - perform a thorough exploratory analysis of the data, understanding the distribution of words and relationship between the words in      the corpora.
  2. Understand frequencies of words and word pairs - build figures and tables to understand variation in the frequencies of words and word pairs in the data.

TASK #2 - MODELING

  The goal here is to build our first simple model for the relationship between words. This is the first step in building a predictive text mining application. We will explore simple models and discover more complicated modeling techniques.

Tasks to accomplish:

  1. Build basic n-gram model for predicting the next word based on the previous 1, 2, or 3 words.
  2. Build a model to handle unseen n-grams - in some cases people will want to type a combination of words that does not appear in the corpora. Build a model to handle cases where a particular n-gram isn't observed.
  

# General adjustments

The raw corpus data is downloaded and stored locally at:

Blog: ./data/en_US.blogs.txt

News: ./data/en_US.news.txt

Twitter: ./data/en_US.twitter.txt

Also, let's load all the library that we need to do above mentioned tasks.

```{r}
suppressMessages(library(NLP))
suppressMessages(library(tm))
suppressMessages(library(RColorBrewer))
suppressMessages(library(wordcloud))
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressMessages(library(stringi))
suppressMessages(library(RWeka))
suppressMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressMessages(library(ngram))
suppressMessages(library(quanteda))
suppressMessages(library(gridExtra))
```


# Load, sample and clean the data

1. Let's first load the data and read lines into variables in R

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# File path
file1 <- "./final/en_US/en_US.blogs.txt"
file2 <- "./final/en_US/en_US.news.txt"
file3 <- "./final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt"
# Read blogs
connect <- file(file1, open="rb")
blogs <- readLines(connect, encoding="UTF-8"); close(connect)
# Read news
connect <- file(file2, open="rb")
news <- readLines(connect, encoding="UTF-8"); close(connect)
# Read twitter
connect <- file(file3, open="rb")
twitter <- readLines(connect, encoding="UTF-8"); close(connect)
rm(connect)
```

2. Let's examine the data and get the sense of data we will be dealing with

```{r, warning=FALSE}
l<-list(blogs, news, twitter)
summaryData <- sapply(l,function(x) summary(stri_count_words(x))[c('Min.','Mean','Max.')])
rownames(summaryData) <- c('Min','Mean','Max')
k<-sapply(l,stri_stats_general)[c('Lines','Chars'),]
w<-sapply(list(blogs,news,twitter),stri_stats_latex)['Words',]
stats <- data.frame(FileName=c("en_US.blogs","en_US.news","en_US.twitter"), t(rbind(k, Words=w, summaryData)))
head(stats)
# Get file sizes
blogs.size <- file.info(file1)$size / 1024 ^ 2
news.size <- file.info(file2)$size / 1024 ^ 2
twitter.size <- file.info(file3)$size / 1024 ^ 2
# Summary of dataset
df<-data.frame(Doc = c("blogs", "news", "twitter"), Size.MB = c(blogs.size, news.size, twitter.size), Num.Lines = c(length(blogs), length(news), length(twitter)), Num.Words=c(sum(nchar(blogs)), sum(nchar(news)), sum(nchar(twitter))))
df
```

3. Since these data are pretty big in size and we only have limited computer memory to process them, we have to sample the data first and then clean the data a bit. In terms of sampling the data, I am going to take 0.1% of each data set to ensure the memory of my machine is sufficient to effectively process the data. I have tried taking 1% but the memory of my machine failed to process it so I had to go for a smaller chunk of the data.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
# Sampling Blogs
idxBlogs<-sample(1:length(blogs), 0.001*length(blogs), replace=FALSE)
sampleBlogs <- blogs[idxBlogs]
# Sampling News
idxNews<-sample(1:length(news), 0.001*length(news), replace=FALSE)
sampleNews <- news[idxNews]
# Sampling Twitter
idxTwitter<-sample(1:length(twitter), 0.001*length(twitter), replace=FALSE)
sampleTwitter <- twitter[idxTwitter]
# Cleaning
sampleBlogs <- iconv(sampleBlogs, "UTF-8", "ASCII", sub="")
sampleNews <- iconv(sampleNews, "UTF-8", "ASCII", sub="")
sampleTwitter <- iconv(sampleTwitter, "UTF-8", "ASCII", sub="")
data.sample <- c(sampleBlogs,sampleNews,sampleTwitter)
```

# Build Corpus and more cleaning

Now that we have sampled our data and combined all three of the data sets into one. We will go ahead and build the corpus which will be used to build the data matrix term later. In this section, we will also apply some more cleaning process to remove lowercase, punctuation, numbers and whitespace.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
build_corpus <- function (x = data.sample) {
  sample_c <- VCorpus(VectorSource(x)) # Create corpus dataset
  sample_c <- tm_map(sample_c, content_transformer(tolower)) # all lowercase
  sample_c <- tm_map(sample_c, removePunctuation) # Eleminate punctuation
  sample_c <- tm_map(sample_c, removeNumbers) # Eliminate numbers
  sample_c <- tm_map(sample_c, stripWhitespace) # Strip Whitespace
}
corpusData <- build_corpus(data.sample)
```


# Tokenize and build n-grams

```{r, warning=FALSE}
getTermTable <- function(corpusData, ngrams = 1, lowfreq = 50) {
  #create term-document matrix tokenized on n-grams
  tokenizer <- function(x) { NGramTokenizer(x, Weka_control(min = ngrams, max = ngrams)) }
  tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(corpusData, control = list(tokenize = tokenizer))
  #find the top term grams with a minimum of occurrence in the corpus
  top_terms <- findFreqTerms(tdm,lowfreq)
  top_terms_freq <- rowSums(as.matrix(tdm[top_terms,]))
  top_terms_freq <- data.frame(word = names(top_terms_freq), frequency = top_terms_freq)
  top_terms_freq <- arrange(top_terms_freq, desc(frequency))
}
    
tt.Data <- list(3)
for (i in 1:3) {
  tt.Data[[i]] <- getTermTable(corpusData, ngrams = i, lowfreq = 10)
}
```

# Build Wordcloud

Let's plot wordcloud to see word frequencies 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Set random seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)
# Set Plotting in 1 row 3 columns
par(mfrow=c(1, 3))
for (i in 1:3) {
  wordcloud(tt.Data[[i]]$word, tt.Data[[i]]$frequency, scale = c(3,1), max.words=100, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0, fixed.asp = TRUE, use.r.layout = FALSE, colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
}
```

# Build n-gram models and histograms

In this section, I build unigram, bi-gram and tri-gram models for the data and will give sense of distributions of the words through histograms

```{r, warning=FALSE}
plot.Grams <- function (x = tt.Data, N=10) {
  g1 <- ggplot(data = head(x[[1]],N), aes(x = reorder(word, -frequency), y = frequency)) + 
        geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green") + 
        ggtitle(paste("Unigrams")) + 
        xlab("Unigrams") + ylab("Frequency") + 
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
  g2 <- ggplot(data = head(x[[2]],N), aes(x = reorder(word, -frequency), y = frequency)) + 
        geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") + 
        ggtitle(paste("Bigrams")) + 
        xlab("Bigrams") + ylab("Frequency") + 
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
  g3 <- ggplot(data = head(x[[3]],N), aes(x = reorder(word, -frequency), y = frequency)) + 
        geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") + 
        ggtitle(paste("Trigrams")) + 
        xlab("Trigrams") + ylab("Frequency") + 
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
  # Put three plots into 1 row 3 columns
  gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1, g2, g3, ncol = 3)
}
plot.Grams(x = tt.Data, N = 20)
```

# Findings and next steps

Next is to plan for Creating Prediction Algorithm and Shiny Application

To train the prediction model:

1. All 3 of the file are very large. Even for the 0.1% of data just to perform the exploratory analysis and ngram model, it look quite a bit of time, so i need    to look at better utilizing the resources and increase the performance.
2. Looking at the unigram frequencies, there are a lot of word overlap between the most frequent words in these 3 files.As next step to this, I need to perform    more data cleaning to remove words such as "the", "of the" and so on.
3. Review on how to remove the mispelled words & not to predict the misspelled word.
4. I have also looked up on Stemming Words using snowball stemmers and will be performing this.
5. I have looked up Markov chain solutions for predicting and I might be using this in next steps.
6. Finally the application will be built in shiny.
